The way you wear your hat,
The way you sip your tea,
The memory of all that,
No, No! They can’t take that away from me!

The way your smile just beams,
The way you sing off key,
The way you haunt my dreams,
No, No! They can’t take that away from me!

We may never, never, meet again,
On the bumpy road to love,
Still I’ll always, always, keep the memory of:

The way you hold your knife,
The way we danced till three,
The way you changed my life,
No, No! They can’t take that away from me!
No! They can’t take that away from me.

No! They can’t take that away!
No, they can’t take that away!
Oh no, they can’t take that away from me!!!
