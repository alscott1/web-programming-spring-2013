I got a guy who’s always late
Every time we have a date
But I love him
Yes I love him
I'm gonna walk right up to his gate
See if I can get it straight
Cause I want him, I'm gonna ask him
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're actin' lately makes me doubt
You’se is still my, baby-baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A man is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You find he's gone and made a change
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true?
~Solo~

Or is my baby still my baby true?
Or is my baby still my baby true?
