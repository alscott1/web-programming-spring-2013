I’m feeling light headed
Feeling faint
Although I’m trying, 
to shed constraints

My Symptoms are quite serious
my pulse runs high
I can’t shake these feelings,
although I try

Somewhere left of middle
in the night
That’s where I first saw you
saw your light
So wrap your arms around me
Take away this pain 
Something deep inside me 
sings out your name

Stars so bright
Sky so blue
Truth be told
It’s all for you…

Stars so bright
Sky so blue
Truth be told
It’s only you

****************************************** Solo 

I wake up from this daydream
with you in my head
Tel-lin’-me-to- re-mem-ber
all that you said

But there’s only little frag-ments
The smell of your hair
My only re-col-lec-tion
is being there


****************** Back to Chorus

Somewhere left of middle
in the night
That’s where I first saw you
saw your light
So wrap your arms around me
take away this pain
Something deep inside me 
sings out your name

Stars so bright
Sky so blue
Truth be told
It’s all for you…

Stars so bright
Sky so blue
Truth be told
It’s only you

Stars so bright
Sky so blue
Truth be told
It’s all for you…
