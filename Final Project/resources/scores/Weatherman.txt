Shut the windows 
And close the doors
The temperature is rising
And were in for more

East wind is blowin’ 
Better close the shade
I told you to leave here
But instead you stayed

They say you’re trouble and you move too fast
Its hard to clearly see
Are you simply hypo the tical
Or really mean to be?

No need to turn to the weatherman
To help predict the rain
It’s only mad ness in the wind
A heatwave in my veins

*****Solo*****(16 bars)

It’s just a change
In the climate trends
A global warming that just won’t end

No way to tell
If its wrong or right
No way to know
Not least tonight 

They say you’re trouble and and you move too fast
Its hard to clearly see
Are you simply hypo the tical
Or really mean to be?

No need to turn to the weatherman
To help predict the rain
It’s only mad ness in the wind
A heatwave in my veins

No need to turn to the weatherman
To help predict the rain
It’s only mad ness in the wind
A heatwave in my veins!!!!
