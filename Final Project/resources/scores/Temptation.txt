Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
everything is made from dreams
time is made from honey slow and sweet
only the fools know what it means

Temptation, temptation, temptation
Oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist

I know that she is made of smoke
but I've lost my wayy
she knows that I am broke
so that I must play

Temptation, temptation, temptation
Oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist

***********SOLO**********

Dutch pink and Italian blue
she is waiting there for you
my will has disappeared
now my confusions oh so clear

Temptation, temptation, temptation
whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation
I can't reisist
