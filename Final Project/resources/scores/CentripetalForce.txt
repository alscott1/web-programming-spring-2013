What ever may happen, 
Or is meant to be,
It will never stop the music, 
When your close to me

We could sail away to some tropical isle, play tunes for the tourists we could dance and smile

It’s the two step I tell you its centripetal force
Not so much a direction as it is a course
So If the boat is leaving,
Are you on board?
You bring the lyrics, and I’ll bring the chords

******Piano Solo********

Some day when your thinking bout the men in your life,
Could they write you a song, could they make it rhyme?

Can they swing-dance…I ask you
Til you can’t see the floor
Can they make the steps
Can they keep the time?

It’s the two step I tell you its centripetal force
Not so much a direction as it is a course
So If the boat is leaving,
Are you on board?
You bring the lyrics, and I’ll bring the chords

******Piano Solo*********
Like Sinatra and Ella
We’ll find the groove
In back of beat, slow and smooth
So we’ll play for the tourists 
And we’ll make them smile
As we live in heaven
On our tropical isle

It’s the two step I tell you its centripetal force
Not so much a direction as it is a course
So If the boat is leaving,
Are you on board?
You bring the lyrics, and I’ll bring the chords!!!!!!!
