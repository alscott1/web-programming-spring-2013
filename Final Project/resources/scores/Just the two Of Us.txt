I see the crystal raindrops fall 
And the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining through 
To make those rainbows in my mind when I think of you sometime 
And I want to spend some time with you 

Just the two of us 
We can make it if we try 
Just the two of us 

Just the two of us 
Building castles in the sky 
Just the two of us 
You and I 

We look for love, no time for tears 
Wasted water's all that is and it don't make no flowers grow 
Good things might come to those who wait, not for those who wait too late 
We've got to go for all we know 

Just the two of us 
We can make it if we try 
Just the two of us 

Just the two of us 
Building them castles in the sky 
Just the two of us 
You and I 
***********Solo*********
I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall 
And it becomes the morning dew 
And, darling, when the morning comes,
And I see the morning sun, 
I wanna be the one with you

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try 
Just the two of us (Just the two of Us)
Just the two of us, building big castles way on high 
Just the two of us, you and I

Just the two of us Yeah, Let's get it together, baby!

Just the Two of Us We can make it Baby Yeah!

Oh Building Castles Way on High, just the two of us

Oh Just the Two of Us!
