Tall and tan and young and lovely, The Girl from Ipanema goes walking,

And when she passes each one she passes goes “ahh!”

When she walks she’s like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gently, 

That when she passes each one she passes goes “ahh!”

Oh, but he watches so sadly

How can he tell her I loves her? 

Yes he would give his heart gladly

But each day when she walks to the sea, she looks straight ahead not at he.

Tall and tan young and lovely the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she 
passes he smiles, but she doesn’t see.
