Let’s put a new coat of paint, on this lonesome old town.
Set ‘em up, we’ll be knockin’ ‘em down.
I’ll wear a dress, you wear a tie, 
We’ll laugh at that old blood shot moon, in that burgundy sky.

****Short Piano Solo****

All our scribbled love dreams, are lost and thrown away,
Here amidst the shuffle, of an overflowin’ day.
Love needs a transfusion; let’s shoot it full of wine.
Fishin’ for a good time starts with throwin’ in your line.

Let’s put a new coat of paint, on this lonesome old town!
Set ‘em up, we’ll be knockin’ ‘em down.
I’ll wear a dress, you wear a tie, 
We’ll laugh at that old blood shot moon, in that burgundy sky!

That old blood shot moon, in that burgundy sky!!
Oh that old bloodshot moon, in that burgundy sky!!
