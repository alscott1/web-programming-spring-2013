Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar, 
Floating on the silence that surrounds us,
Quiet thoughts and Quiet dreams,
Quiet walks by quiet streams,
And a window, that looks out on, Corcovado, Oh how lovely!

This is where I want to be, 
Here with you so close to me!
Until the final flicker of life’s ember,

I who was lost and lonely, believing life was only, 
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence, Oh my love
