So close your eyes
For that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes 
Whenever two can dream a dream together

You can't deny
Don 't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above, and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes 
Whenever two can dream a dream together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know 
The wave is on its way to be
Just catch the wave, don't be afraid, of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes 
Whenever two can dream a dream together
