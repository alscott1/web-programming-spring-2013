I go out walking, after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I’m always walking, after midnight
Searching for you

I walk for miles, along the highway
Well, that’s just, my way, of saying, “I-love-you”
I’m always walking, after midnight
Searching for you

I stop to see a weeping willow, crying on his pillow
Maybe he’s crying for me______
And as the skies turn gloomy,
Night winds to me
I’m lonesome as I can be

I go out walking, after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just hoping you may be
Somewhere a-walking after midnight
Searching for me
