Love me or leave me, and let me be lonely; 
You won’t believe me and I love you only;
Rather be lonely then happy with somebody else.

You might the nighttime’s the right time for kissing;
But nighttime is my time for just reminiscing, regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else.

There’ll be no one unless that someone is you, you, you.
I intend to be independently blue, blue, blue!
I want your love, but I don’t wanna borrow,
Have it today, give back tomorrow;
For my love is your love, there’s no love for nobody else!
