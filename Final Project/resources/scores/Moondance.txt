Well it’s a marvelous night for a Moondance with the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance ‘neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I’m trying to please to the calling, of your heart strings that play soft and low 

And all the night’s magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have on more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well I wanna make love to you tonight, I can’t wait ‘till the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right, and into my arms you will run

And when you come my heart will be waiting, to make sure that you’re never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true dear,there and then I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I now how mush you want me that you can’t hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make one more moondance with you my love?

One more moondance with you,
In the moonlight,
On a majic night,

La, La, La, La, La

In the moonlight___
On a Majic night

Can I Just Have One More Moondance With You, My Love?
